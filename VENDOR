  VENDOR CHANGES
  ==============

  APPLICATION RULES
  -----------------

  The rpm5.org code base to a very restricted and limited scope contains
  some RPM changes from third-party distribution vendors. A vendor patch
  *might* be accepted for inclusion into the rpm5.org code base if it at
  least follows the following rules *and* is accepted after a detailed
  review by JBJ:

  1. RULE:
     at least one representative of a vendor has to be part of the
     official rpm5.org developer team. Additionally, the vendor and its
     representative is explicitly listed below.

  2. RULE:
     all source code changes have to be really surgically and
     minimally touching the rpm5.org code base only (no large code
     block reorderings, no accidential whitespace changes, etc).
     Additionally, all changes have to be *entirely* wrapped with "#if
     defined(RPM_VENDOR_<name-id>) /* <change-id> */... #endif" where
     <name-id> and <change-id> are explicitly listed in this document
     below under "Name" and "Change".

  VENDOR REGISTRY
  ---------------

  o  Name:           OPENPKG
     Vendor:         OpenPKG <http://openpkg.org/>
     Representative: Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@openpkg.org> <rse@rpm5.org>
     Application:    RPM-based Unix software distribution (> 1100 packages),
     Characteristic: cross-platform multiple-instance use of RPM
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         splitted-source-directory
     Purpose:        support so-called "splitted source directories", i.e.,
                     source files (listed on SourceX and PatchX headers)
                     can be placed into %{_specdir} in addition to
                     %{_sourcedir}.
     Reason:         OpenPKG ultra-strictly separates sources files into
                     two classes: external ones -- those which are
                     referenced with fully-qualified URLs and can be
                     (re-)fetched from the Internet -- and internal
                     ones -- those which are references as plain files
                     and which are kept in the local version control
                     system (VCS). As in OpenPKG the .spec file is just
                     one of those "internal" files, they are all stored
                     under %{_specdir} while %{_sourcedir} is used
                     for everything which is downloaded from external
                     sources (in OpenPKG even an automated process).
     Hint:           The even better solution would be to introduce
                     %{_sourcedir_external} and %{_sourcedir_internal}
                     and support this throughout RPM.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         explicit-platform
     Purpose:        Allow the platform identification be set explicitly only.
     Reason:         As OpenPKG is a cross-platform distribution,
                     the "platform" had to be determined by GNU shtool's
                     "shtool platform" script since many years. The
                     result is stored into the "platform" file which
                     RPM internally reads in. This way the platform is
                     explicitly set and no other implicit sets wished.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         extra-section-track
     Purpose:        Add support for custom section "%track",
                     a package build-time section containing a script
                     which can check whether the current package is
                     still based on the latest upstream vendor version.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG all "external" sources (see above)
                     are automatically and bi-daily tracked for new
                     available versions from the upstream vendor. For
                     this OpenPKG places vcheck(1) based config snippets
                     into its %track sections and lets them be executed
                     through vcheck(1) via "rpm -bt".
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         extra-section-test
     Purpose:        Add support for custom section "%test",
                     a package install-time section containing a script
                     which can check whether the current package is
                     working under run-time, usually by executing some
                     commands of the package.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we want some form of package regression
                     tests which are directly attached to the packages.
                     Unfortunately, we never got to the point of using
                     %test until now. Shame on us!
     Hint:           This is not tested at all as it is still unused!
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-deps-on-building-srpms
     Purpose:        Do not perform any dependency checking on building SRPMs.
     Reason:         We never found any reason why this is of any benefit for
                     just rolling a source RPM package.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         always-remove-tempfiles
     Purpose:        Unconditionally remove temporary files ("rpm-tmp.XXXXX")
                     which were generated for the executed scripts.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we run the scripts in debug mode ("set -x")
                     anyway, so we never need to see the whole generated
                     script -- not even if it breaks. Instead we would
                     just have temporary files staying around forever.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-default-doc-files
     Purpose:        Do not declare some files as %doc by default.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we want to be explicit in the declaration
                     of %doc files and do it entirely from a package
                     %files section only. No magic in the code wished.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         support-srcdefattr
     Purpose:        allow to set SRPM file attributes via %{_srcdefattr} macro
     Reason:         This makes the generated SRPMs look more uniform
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         still-support-section-clean
     Purpose:        allow us to still use %clean section
     Reason:         for temporary backward compatibility only
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         not-fully-arbitrary-tags
     Purpose:        do not allow fully arbitrary tags/headers
     Reason:         we want to allow only those extra tags which are
                     explicitly configured in the macros
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         always-backup-on-patching
     Purpose:        always create backup files on patching files via %patch
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we maintain our patches via "rpm -bp" plus
                     subsequent "svs" commands, so we always want that
                     backup files are created.
     Hint:           We could explicitly specify -b all the time, too.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-require-bin-sh
     Purpose:        do not implicitly add a requirement for /bin/sh
     Reason:         In OpenPKG RPM does not operate on operating system
                     scope. Instead it operates in a fully
                     self-contained multiple-instance environment.
                     There /bin/sh is NEVER provided by an OpenPKG RPM
                     package.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-no-partial-locking
     Purpose:        Perform full instead of partial record locking.
     Reason:         At least Solaris may reject (see its fcntl(2) manpage)
                     the (partial) locking, because BDB mmap(2)'ed the file
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-bugfix-fcntl-usage
     Purpose:        Fix the usage of fcntl(2)
     Reason:         POSIX/SUSv3 clearly expresses that fcntl(2)
                     returns "value other than -1" on success, so check
                     for equality to -1 instead of non-equality to 0.
                     In practice this does not harm on most platforms,
                     because they fortunately (by conincidence and
                     common practice) return 0.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-use-odirect-on-freebsd-only
     Purpose:        Use O_DIRECT on FreeBSD only
     Reason:         The O_DIRECT feature is fully broken under at least Linux
                     2.2 and 2.4. It is sometimes accepted by open(2)
                     without error and later causes a write(2) to fail
                     with EINVAL -- all depending on the underlying
                     filesystem (usually works on tmpfs and fails on
                     ext3). Sometimes it also causes open(2) to fail
                     with EINVAL. In general, it does especially no
                     "graceful degradation" and so is useless for use on
                     mostly all platforms except for those where we know
                     it works (currently FreeBSD only). Interestingly,
                     RPM works on RedHat, just because RedHat's "kernel"
                     package contains a patch which masks out O_DIRECT
                     usage... ;-)
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-owner-group-on-srpm-install
     Purpose:        Do not set owner/group on installation/unpacking of SRPM
     Reason:         In OpenPKG it is not wished that file owner/group are
                     set on files during installation of _source_ RPMs.
                     Instead, the current run-time owner/group should
                     be used, because most of the time the owner/group
                     in the source RPM (which is the owner/group of the
                     files as staying on the package author system) is
                     not existing on the target system anyway.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         switch-from-susr-to-musr-on-srpm-install
     Purpose:        If running as the OpenPKG "susr", do not unpack source
                     RPM packages with "susr" file ownerships. Instead
                     unpack with "musr" file ownerships.
     Reason:         The OpenPKG Set-UID wrapper switches from "musr" to
                     "susr" on "openpkg rpm -Uvh *.src.rpm". As a result
                     the installed files could be never removed again by
                     "musr". It is more consistent to always unpack as
                     "musr" if possible.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         adjust-verbose-listing
     Purpose:        In verbose file listing output, give the owner and group
                     fields more width and at the same time reduce the
                     fields more nlink and size to typical sizes within
                     fields more OpenPKG.
     Reason:         Just cosmetics to improve output.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         larger-utsname
     Purpose:        Increase size of "struct utsname"
     Reason:         OpenPKG requires more space for storage
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         platform-major-minor-only
     Purpose:        Reduce the platform version to major and minor version numbers only.
     Reason:         Experience shows that more is never reasonable in practice.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         allow-excludedocs-default
     Purpose:        Do not override the %{_excludedocs} macro.
     Reason:         The "%_excludedocs" macro is intended to set the
                     _default_ if both --excludedocs and --includedocs
                     are not specified and it is evaluated already
                     before. So, do not override it here again, because
                     it would not allow us to make "%_excludedocs 1" the
                     default.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-allow-zero-sized-files
     Purpose:        Make sure RPM passes DB_CREATE to Berkeley-DB also
                     if file exists, but is (still) zero-sized.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG all database files are pre-created
                     to fixate permissions.
     Hint:           This might be obsolete soon as we now create real
                     BDB files instead of empty files.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-architecture-expose
     Purpose:        Do not expose the architecture in outputs.
     Reason:         This is too less information, as in OpenPKG the
                     "platform" is described by the
                     architecture+operating-system combination. But
                     as the whole "platform" information is actually
                     overkill, just revert to the RPM 4 behaviour and do
                     not expose any such information at all
     Hint:           FIXME, not sufficient: still some information exposed during
                     rpm -qa for the case of public keys.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         fixed-size-macro-buffer
     Purpose:        Use a fixed 16KB buffer for macro expansion.
     Reason:         Don't use the stdio variable BUFSIZ because it is of
                     unknown size. Usually, it is just 1024 on some
                     platforms but on Linux it can be even 8192. Use a
                     fixed 16KB buffer in OpenPKG for now.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         patch-as-plain-macro
     Purpose:        Use %patch as a plain macro instead of internal implementation.
     Reason:         The macro is more flexible and we especially can introduce
                     some Lua-based substitution magic there more easily.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         stop-on-error-macro
     Purpose:        Make sure that an %{error:<msg>} macro really stops further
                     processing. Else it would be nothing more than a %{warn:<msg>}.
     Reason:         OpenPKG wants that %error results in a processing stop.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         auto-remove-source-directories
     Purpose:        Automatically remove source directories if they are empty.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we use per-package %{_sourcedir} and
                     %{_specdir} definitions (macros have trailing
                     ".../%{name}"). On removal of source(s) and .spec
                     file, this per-package directory would be kept
                     (usually <prefix>/RPM/SRC/<name>/), because RPM
                     does not know about this OpenPKG convention. So,
                     let RPM try(!) to remove the two directories (if
                     they are empty) and just ignore removal failures
                     (if they are still not empty).
