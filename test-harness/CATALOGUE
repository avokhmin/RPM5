TEST #	TYPE	COMMENTS
==============================================================================
1		ARB		Install a working one followed by a fail in %pre.  
				Should rollback both working and broken packages.
				thereafter (i.e. a rollback should occur).
2		ARB		Install one that fails in %pre first.  It should be a wash.
3				Install a working one, followed by one that fails in %post.
				Both should be rolled back.
4		ARB		Setup installs works-1-1, then the test attempts to upgrade 
				to works-1-2 and install broken-1-1 which is broken in %pre.
				The end result is a backout to works-1-1.
5		ARB		This is test 4, but the scriplets check to see if the backout
				semaphore exists or not and prints messages concerning its 
				existance.  Also they touch a file if they saw the semaphore.
6		ARB		Test 4 with relocations.
7		ARB		Test an upgrade that does not need to rollback
8		ARB		Same as test 4, but breaks in %post.
9		ARB		Install works-1-1 and broken-1-1.  Now erase works-1-1 and
				broken-1-1.  broken-1-1 will fail in %preun.
10		ARB		Install works-1-1 and broken-1-1.  Now erase works-1-1 and
				broken-1-1.  broken-1-1 will fail in %postun.
11      ARB		Install works-1-1 and broken-1-1.  Now upgrade to works-1-2
				and broken-1-2.  broken-1-1 will fail in %preun.
12      ARB		Install works-1-1 and broken-1-1.  Now upgrade to works-1-2
				and broken-1-2.  broken-1-1 will fail in %postun.
13		ARB		Install t1-1-1 and t2-1-1.   t1 depends on t2.  t1 also has
				a trigger on t2.  Then upgrade t1.  Nothing is broken
				only cheking trigger instance counts.
14 		I		Install t1-1-1 and t2-1-1.   t2 depends on t21  t1 also has
				a trigger on t2.  Then upgrade to t1-1-2 and t2-1-2.  Nothing is
				broken only cheking trigger instance counts.  This by the way
				tests a sucessfull upgrade with multiple te's.
15		ARB		Install t1-1-1 which installs a config file that it modifies in
				 %post.  Install t1-1-2 and broken-1-1.  broken-1-1 fails in 
				%post.  Tests whether autorollback's are tolerant of 
				repackaged packages with modified config files.
16		ARB		Same as 15 except that it is a modified non-config file.
17		ARB		Install works-1-1.  Then upgrade to works-1-2 and install 
				broken-1-1 Finally upgrade to works-2-0 and broken-1-2.  
				Broken 1-2 will fail in %pre.  Autorollback should rollback 
				works-2-0 and then broken-1-2.  It should use the arbgoal to 
				rollback the second transaction leaving only works-1-1 on the 
				system.
18		RB		install test-1-1, and then upgrade to test-1-2.  Finally roll
				this back.  We should be left with test-1-1, and the order
				of execution of the rollback transaction should be install
				test-1-1 and then erase test-1-2
19		RB		Same as 18 except we add package test2 and test3 which both
				get installed and upgraded as before.
20		I       Simple install of one package p1-1-1 that has %pre, %post
                %preun and %postun scriptlets that are vary short.  Good
                for detecting a particular scriptlet lockup bug.
21      ARB     Test 17 except now the broken package has broken dependencies.
                Tests autorollback goal in the case that the error is a 
                pre-transaction check (specifically missing dependencies).
22      RB      Install a package test-1-1, now upgrade to test-1-2.  Next,
                rollback to test-1-1, except that test-1-1 will fail in %pre
                at this point.  Should snip the erasure of test-1-2.  If not 
                you end up with zero "test" packages installed.
23      RB      Install a package test-1-1.  test-1-1 will intentionally remove
                one of its files from the system in %post.  Now upgrade to 
                test-1-2; when test-1-1 is repackaged it will have a missing
                file.  Next, rollback to test-1-1.
                Should rollback fine.  As of this writting this test case
                it will not but will fail with an unknown file type cpio
                error.
24		RB		Install test-1-1, then roll it back.  This is a simple test
				of rolling back an install.  This began in rpm 4.4.5.

25 		I		Install t1-1-1 and t2-1-1.   t1 depends on t2.  t1 also has
				a trigger on t2.  Then upgrade to t1-1-2 and t2-1-2.  Nothing is
				broken only cheking trigger instance counts.  This by the way
				tests a sucessfull upgrade with multiple te's.
26		ARB		
				Install works-1-1 for setup.  Next upgrade to works-1-2.  
                Finally upgrade to works-2-0, but fail in %pre.
27		ARB
				Install works-1-1 for setup.  Next upgrade to works-1-2.  
                Finally upgrade to works-2-0, but fail in %post.
28		ARB     Test 17, but we fail in %post of broken-1-2.
29		RB		Test 25, but we don't fail installing works-2-0, and just 
				manually rollback.
30		RB		Test 17, but we don't fail installing broken-1-2, and just
				manually rollback.
