QUERY FORMATS
=============

As it is impossible to please everyone with one style of query output, RPM
allows you to specify what information should be printed during a query
operation and how it should be formatted.

Tags
----

All of the information a package contains, apart from signatures and the
actual files, is in a part of the package called the header. Each piece
of information in the header has a tag associated with it which allows
RPM to to tell the difference between the name and description of a
package.

To get a list of all of the tags your version of RPM knows about, run the
command 'rpm --querytags'. It will print out a list like (but much longer
then) this:

    RPMTAG_NAME
    RPMTAG_VERSION
    RPMTAG_RELEASE
    RPMTAG_SERIAL
    RPMTAG_SUMMARY
    RPMTAG_DESCRIPTION
    RPMTAG_BUILDTIME
    RPMTAG_BUILDHOST
    RPMTAG_INSTALLTIME
    RPMTAG_SIZE

As all of these tags begin with RPMTAG_, you may omit it from query format
specifiers and it will be omitted from the rest of this documentation for
the same reason.

A tag can consist of one element or an array of elements. Each element can
be a string or number only.

Query Formats
-------------

A query format is passed to RPM after the --queryformat argument, and normally
should be enclosed in single quotes. This query format is then used to print
the information section of a query. This means that when both -i and 
--queryformat are used in a command, the -i is essentially ignored.

The query format is similar to a C style printf string, which the printf(2)
man page provides a good introduction to. However, as RPM already knows the
type of data that is being printed, you must omit the type specifier. In
its place put the tag name you with to print enclosed in curly braces
({}). For example, the following RPM command prints the names and sizes
of all of the packages installed on a system:

    rpm -qa --queryformat "%{NAME} %{SIZE}\n"

If you want to use printf formatters, they go between the % and {. To
change the above command to print the NAME in the first 30 bytes and
right align the size to, use:

    rpm -qa --queryformat "%-30{NAME} %10{SIZE}\n"

Arrays
------

RPM uses many parallel arrays internally. For example, file sizes and 
file names are kept as an array of numbers and an array of strings
respectively, with the first element in the size array corresponding
to the first element in the name array. 

To iterate over a set of parallel arrays, enclose the format to be used
to print each item in the array within square brackets ([]). For example,
to print all of the files and their sizes in the slang-devel package
followed by their sizes, with one file per line, use this command:

    rpm -q --queryformat "[%-50{FILENAMES} %10{FILESIZES}\n]" slang-devel

Note that since the trailing newline is inside of the square brackets, one
newline is printed for each filename.

Formatting Tags
---------------

One of the weaknesses with query formats is that it doesn't recognize
that the INSTALLTIME tag (for example) should be printed as a date instead
of as a number. To compensate, you can specify one of a few different
formats to use when printing tags by placing a colon followed the formatting 
name after the tag name. Here are some examples:

    rpm -q --queryformat "%{NAME} %{INSTALLTIME:date}\n" fileutils
    rpm -q --queryformat "[%{FILEMODES:perms} %{FILENAMES}\n]" rpm
    rpm -q --queryformat \
	"[%{REQUIRENAME} %{REQUIREFLAGS:depflags} %{REQUIREVERSION}\n]" \
	vlock
