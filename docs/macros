SPEC FILE MACROS
================

RPM 2.3.9 introduces simple spec file macros.  The macros can do
straight text substitution only.  Macros can be used anywhere in
a spec file, and in "included file lists" (those read in using
%files -f <file>).

Defining a Macro
----------------

To define a macro use:

%define <name> <expansion>

All whitespace surrounding <expansion> is removed.  Name may be composed
of alphanumeric characters, and the character `_'.  Macro expansion is
performed on <expansion> so that <expansion> my reference other macros
that have already been defined.

Using a Macro
-------------

To use a macro, write:

%<name>

or

%{<name>}

The later allows you to place the expansion adjacent to other text.

Predefined Macros
-----------------

The following macros are defined as the values they reference are
specified in the spec file:

PACKAGE_VERSION
PACKAGE_RELEASE
