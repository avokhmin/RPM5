  RELEASE ENGINEERING ROADMAP
  ---------------------------

  This is the current RPM 5.0 release engineering roadmap:

  1. weekly Alpha releases in November 2007:
     - APIs:     still changing, no guarantees at all for stability
     - code:     still acceptable to be at least partly broken
     - audience: early adopters in RPM community only
     - purpose:  to get initial feedback
 
     2007-11-10  RPM 5.0a1   RPM 5.0 alpha 1                [DONE]
     2007-11-19  RPM 5.0a2   RPM 5.0 alpha 2                [DONE]
     2007-11-24  RPM 5.0a3   RPM 5.0 alpha 3                [DONE]
     2007-12-02  RPM 5.0a4   RPM 5.0 alpha 4                [DONE]
 
  2. weekly Beta releases in December 2007:
     - APIs:     mostly fixed, nearly a guarantee to be stable
     - code:     already stable, but perhaps still some subtle bugs
     - audience: RPM community, especially distro vendors
     - purpose:  to get final feedback
   
     2007-12-08  RPM 5.0b1   RPM 5.0 beta 1                 [TODO]
     2007-12-15  RPM 5.0b2   RPM 5.0 beta 2                 [TODO]
     2007-12-22  RPM 5.0b3   RPM 5.0 beta 3                 [TODO]
     2007-12-29  RPM 5.0b4   RPM 5.0 beta 4                 [TODO]
   
  3. release in January 2008:
     - APIs:     fully fixed, guaranteed to be kept stable
     - code:     stable, no more bugs known bugs left 
     - audience: RPM community as a whole
     - purpose:  provide RPM 5.0
   
     2007-01-05  CVS HEAD is branched into    RPM 5.0.x     [TODO]
     2007-01-05  CVS HEAD now becomes base of RPM 5.1.DEVEL [TODO]
     2007-01-05  RPM 5.0.0   RPM 5.0 patchlevel 0           [TODO]
     2007-01-05  press release                              [TODO]
     ...

  KNOWN PENDING ISSUES
  --------------------

  This is the list of known pending issues which still *HAVE* to be
  resolved during release engineering. Please do not just list any
  *CANDO* items.

  o to be resolved before RPM 5.0b1:
    - rse: xar/ has weak (think RPM_CHECK_LIB) support its third-party libraries LibXML, OpenSSL, etc.
    - afb: remove xar and libxar from default install with internal xar (use through rpm and librpm*)
    - afb: make sure %standalone devtool target includes support for xar
    - jbj: RPM_I18NSTRING_TYPE is likely still wonky, certainly true for
	rpm-python h['summary'] access.
    - jbj: markReplacedFiles() subtly rewrites header back into rpmdb
	with altered RPMTAG_FILESTATES data. get/del/add sequence
	is needed instead.
    - jbj: check that rpmbuild --sign is functional, or eliminate the option.
    - jbj: choose between db-4.5.20 and db-4.6.21. db-4.5.20 may have fewer
	upgrade/downgrade issues because of the db-4.6.21 DB_HASH change,
	but rpm-5.0 already uses DB_BTREE for Packages.
    - jbj: rpm-5.0 is almost compilation warning free, some effort to remove
	the Mickey Mouse warnings that remain should be undertaken.
    - jbj: memory leak seen with repackaging
==4811== 249 bytes in 3 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==4811==    at 0x4805525: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:149)
==4811==    by 0x48E1C14: copyEntry (header.c:1446)
==4811==    by 0x48E33A6: headerNext (header.c:2208)
==4811==    by 0x48DF183: headerRegenSigHeader (hdrNVR.c:303)
==4811==    by 0x4877D11: rpmpsmStage (psm.c:1904)
==4811==    by 0x4876C7D: rpmpsmNext (psm.c:1580)
==4811==    by 0x48790C2: rpmpsmStage (psm.c:2244)
==4811==    by 0x48A9C83: rpmtsRun (transaction.c:1689)
==4811==    by 0x4897D28: rpmErase (rpminstall.c:627)
==4811==    by 0x43FC: main (rpmqv.c:678)
    - jbj: blueprinting *.rpm and *.src rpm contents built with
	rpm-4.5 and rpm-5.0 indicates another likely signature padding
	calculation problem (- is 4.5 built src.rpm, + is 5.0 built src.rpm)
-  Sigsize: 107888
-  Pkgid:     !!binary YkBolGxVnon0gGm8YV5lug==
-  Hdrid: 827180de364f6948e94623b29dffa13e45898227
+  Sigsize: 107896
+  Pkgid:     !!binary pM5VJBrMT40gEk4TSvNrdA==
+  Hdrid: 72a11d90029ae1fbd61cd3741f4bb25681d8546d
	(other contents are now identical after fixing RPMTAG_BUILDTIME).
    - jbj: rpmMergeHeadersFromFD has gone AWOL and is needed by yum
	/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rpm/_rpmmodule.so: undefined symbol: rpmMergeHeadersFromFD
    - jbj: retrieved headers are failing sanity checks.


  o to be resolved before RPM 5.0.0:
    - rse: NEWS polishing

  RPM 5.1 ROADMAP ISSUES
  ----------------------
    - jbj: Heh, --import has *always* used the wrong data type for
	Summary/Description/Group. The header that carries the pubkey
	lacks RPMTAG_ARCH/RPMTAG_OS as well. Re-importing all pubkeys is
	one solution, but perhaps a "just works" slam-dunk hack is needed
	during --rebuildb, or with header extensions. When this issue is
	resolved, then rpm can/should use implicit, rather than explicit, data
	types for tag data.
