  RELEASE ENGINEERING ROADMAP

  KNOWN PENDING ISSUES
  --------------------

  This is the list of known pending issues which still *HAVE* to be
  resolved during release engineering. Please do not just list any
  *CANDO* items.

  - /usr/lib64 is reported not expanded into rpm.pc pkgconfig fle and
	___init.py___.

  - distributing per-platform configuration needs to be done. At a minimum,
	the cpu-os.macros.tar.gz file needs distributing with the rpm tarball.

  - decide on whether rpmbuild --lsb should be included (or not).

  - pkgioRead() has a cosmetic error message if/when called after end-of-header
	(or equivalent EOF) condition. The current fix is mapping return to
	RPMRC_NOTFOUND, but RPMRC_OK with 0 length EOF read may be necessary.

	...
        /* XXX Handle EOF's as RPMRC_NOTFOUND, not RPMRC_FAIL, returns. */
        if (xx == 0)
            rc = RPMRC_NOTFOUND;
        else
	...
