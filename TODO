  KNOWN PENDING ISSUES
  --------------------

  This is the list of known pending issues which still *HAVE* to be
  resolved during release engineering. Please do not just list any
  *CANDO* items.

  - /usr/lib64 is reported not expanded into rpm.pc pkgconfig fle and
	___init.py___.

  - distributing per-platform configuration needs to be done. At a minimum,
	the cpu-os.macros.tar.gz file needs distributing with the rpm tarball.
