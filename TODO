  KNOWN PENDING ISSUES
  --------------------

  This is the list of known pending issues which still *HAVE* to be
  resolved during release engineering. Please do not just list any
  *CANDO* items.

  - /usr/lib64 is reported not expanded into rpm.pc pkgconfig fle and
	___init.py___.

  - distributing per-platform configuration needs to be done. At a minimum,
	the cpu-os.macros.tar.gz file needs distributing with the rpm tarball.

   - 2-4 applications are having trouble compiling against rpm-5.0.0, largely
	(my guess) because header.h has been removed. A stub to retrofit
	could be done, but then the question will become headerGetEntry
	(and other) symbols. Which also could be retrofit'ed if there
	as interest, noone replied when I asked repeatedly. Alternatively,
	just doing the port to rpm-5.0.0 is likely not hard at all.

   - smart (and perhaps other python apps) may need archscore method
	restored. rpmPlatformScore() is functionally equivalent replacement.
