  RELEASE ENGINEERING ROADMAP
  ---------------------------

  This is the current RPM 5.0 release engineering roadmap:

  1. weekly Alpha releases in November 2007:
     - APIs:     still changing, no guarantees at all for stability
     - code:     still acceptable to be at least partly broken
     - audience: early adopters in RPM community only
     - purpose:  to get initial feedback
 
     2007-11-10  RPM 5.0a1   RPM 5.0 alpha 1                [DONE]
     2007-11-19  RPM 5.0a2   RPM 5.0 alpha 2                [DONE]

     2007-12-02  RPM 5.0a4   RPM 5.0 alpha 4                [DONE]
 
  2. weekly Beta releases in December 2007:
     - APIs:     mostly fixed, nearly a guarantee to be stable
     - code:     already stable, but perhaps still some subtle bugs
     - audience: RPM community, especially distro vendors
     - purpose:  to get final feedback

     ...

  KNOWN PENDING ISSUES
  --------------------

  This is the list of known pending issues which still *HAVE* to be
  resolved during release engineering. Please do not just list any
  *CANDO* items.

  o to be resolved before RPM 5.0.0:
    - rse: xar/ has weak (think RPM_CHECK_LIB) support its third-party
           libraries LibXML, OpenSSL, etc. But we at least support building
           against external XAR, so this issue is no longer such dramatic IMHO.
    - rse: NEWS polishing
    - jbj: fix openssl RSA signature verification.
    - jbj: finish Requires: sanitycheck(N) = E:V-R runtime probe.
    - jbj: finish BuildRequires: vcheck(N) = E:V-R runtime probe.
    - jbj: write up added featlets/bugtures in %docdir notes.
    - jbj: handle SourceN: foo-V-R.src.rpm unpacking.
    - jbj: fix (or at least document) the /sbin/ldconfig optimization flaw.
    - jbj: finish --trust with --import (or punt to 5.1).
    - jbj: add build script templates for install scriptlets (or punt to 5.1).
    - jbj: add the wiring for RPMTAG_CLASS as an arbitrary tag.
    - jbj: change RPM_I18NSTRING_TYPE wiring to use arbitrary tag.
    - jbj: add lazy mkdir -p to handle packaging pathologies like in
	devtool-test.spec (no mkdir -p in %install).
    - jbj: fold-in patch-as-plain-macro at first convenient opportunity.
    - jbj: ditto, patch-as-plain-macro.
    - jbj: add macro disabler for scriptlet interpreter dependencies, fold
	in no-require-bin-sh patch.
    - jbj: Mandriva perl-URPM "make test" indicates a problem querying binary
	package headers that would be produced by a spec file.
	Dvalin has found that reverting this patch
		http://rpm5.org/cvs/chngview?cn=6994
	restores legacy behavior (but breaks other "stuff" I believe). So
	the patch needs some re-balancing before being added to rpm-5.0.
    - jbj: markReplacedFiles() subtly rewrites header back into rpmdb
	with altered RPMTAG_FILESTATES data. get/del/add sequence
	is needed instead.
    - jbj: VSFlags (and --nodigest/--nosignature) is now global rather than
	persistently per-transaction. That means its no longer possible to
	have two transactions, one which verifies signatures while the other
	does not. Per-transaction VSFlags never made much sense imho, but
	some may care. Establishing a end-user, not a per-application or
	per-transaction, package integrity/security policy is the only
	rational end-point.
    - jbj: blueprinting *.rpm and *.src rpm contents built with
	rpm-4.5 and rpm-5.0 indicates another possible signature padding
	calculation problem (- is 4.5 built src.rpm, + is 5.0 built src.rpm)
-  Sigsize: 107888
-  Pkgid:     !!binary YkBolGxVnon0gGm8YV5lug==
-  Hdrid: 827180de364f6948e94623b29dffa13e45898227
+  Sigsize: 107896
+  Pkgid:     !!binary pM5VJBrMT40gEk4TSvNrdA==
+  Hdrid: 72a11d90029ae1fbd61cd3741f4bb25681d8546d
	(other contents are now identical after fixing RPMTAG_BUILDTIME).
    - jbj: there's a buildroot compatibility issue that needs to be addressed
	in (at least) doco. The problem is common to rpm-4_5 and HEAD.
	Issue at
		http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=34705
    - jbj: both --yaml and --xml are in need of a QA sanity check. All that
	needs doing is insuring that rpm qa --yaml can be loaded by some
	existing yaml parser, and that the xml parses correctly. The YAML
	is likelier to be borked than the XML.
    - jbj: make a complete pass through rpm.org check-ins and make sure they
	have exactly zero "features" that are not already in rpm-5.0. With
	full attribution of course ...


  RPM 5.1 ROADMAP ISSUES
  ----------------------
    - jbj: Heh, --import has *always* used the wrong data type for
	Summary/Description/Group. The header that carries the pubkey
	lacks RPMTAG_ARCH/RPMTAG_OS as well. Re-importing all pubkeys is
	one solution, but perhaps a "just works" slam-dunk hack is needed
	during --rebuildb, or with header extensions. When this issue is
	resolved, then rpm can/should use implicit, rather than explicit, data
	types for tag data.
    - jbj: add libTomCrypt signature verification.
    - jbj: add per-implementation crypto hashes.
    - jbj: add per-implementation symmetric ciphers.
    - jbj: permit per-file encryption with password caching through keyutils.
    - jbj: generalize the Leopard XAR format to ar (as in *.deb), tar, and cpio.
    - jbj: eliminate the oddball *.src.rpm paths, nuke rpmInstallSourcePackage.
    - jbj: VPATH-like generalization to fold-in splitted-source-directory patch.
    - jbj: add per file RPMTAG_ENTROPY a la Shannon to start making the choice
	of compression scheme computible.
    - jbj: explicitly compute sums of header and package sizes to help
	distro maintainers understand their cdrom/dvd and memory footprint
	needs.
    - jbj: split rpmtsRun() into 2 pieces, moving the file resolution
	computation into its own method.
    - jbj: redesign the bleeping callback, which is good for nothing but pushing
	script kiddie progress bars across the screen.
    - jbj: arbitrary "%foo -p /bar" scriptlets as pair'ed RPMTAG_{FOO,FOOPROG}.
    - jbj: arbitrary triggers, like scriptlets, but with a condition check too.
    - jbj: the hash *ahem* algorithm at rpmdb/fprint.c:186 fpHashFunction() is
	pathetic. FYI, the fingerprint hash is in the top 10 pigs when
	profiling rpm installs, so better has immediate performance benefits.
	rpmio/lookup3.c is possibly better. The other important usage case
	is restructuring the multi-level add package "provides" lookup in
	lib/rpmal.c (but that likely needs to be thrown into a Berkeley DB
	table to minimize memory footprint).
    - jbj: using qsort to insure that nearly sorted lists of join keys in
	an rpmdb remain sorted is stoopid: quicksort on nearly sorted lists
	is slower than alternative implementations like mergesort.
    - jbj: eliminate internal --initdb (useless) and --verifydb (peculier
	to Berkeley DB and adequately/equivalently achievable with db_verify).
    - jbj: NSS has many memory leaks that are not free'd by NSS_Shutdown().
    - jbj: this leak needs fixing somewhen:
==3436== 12 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 3 of 9
==3436==    at 0x4805525: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:149)
==3436==    by 0x4934365: argvSplit (argv.c:207)
==3436==    by 0x48F89F9: tagLoadATags (tagname.c:31)
==3436==    by 0x48F969E: _tagValue (tagname.c:361)
==3436==    by 0x48F9805: tagValue (tagname.c:403)
==3436==    by 0x48878F9: rpmdsSysinfo (rpmds.c:1600)
