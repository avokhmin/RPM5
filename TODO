  RELEASE ENGINEERING ROADMAP
  ---------------------------

  This is the current RPM 5.0 release engineering roadmap:

  1. weekly Alpha releases in November 2007:
     - APIs:     still changing, no guarantees at all for stability
     - code:     still acceptable to be at least partly broken
     - audience: early adopters in RPM community only
     - purpose:  to get initial feedback
 
     2007-11-10  RPM 5.0a1   RPM 5.0 alpha 1                [DONE]
     2007-11-19  RPM 5.0a2   RPM 5.0 alpha 2                [DONE]
     2007-11-24  RPM 5.0a3   RPM 5.0 alpha 3                [DONE]
     2007-12-02  RPM 5.0a4   RPM 5.0 alpha 4                [DONE]
 
  2. weekly Beta releases in December 2007:
     - APIs:     mostly fixed, nearly a guarantee to be stable
     - code:     already stable, but perhaps still some subtle bugs
     - audience: RPM community, especially distro vendors
     - purpose:  to get final feedback
   
     2007-12-09  RPM 5.0b1   RPM 5.0 beta 1                 [DONE]
     2007-12-15  RPM 5.0b2   RPM 5.0 beta 2                 [DONE]
     2007-12-22  RPM 5.0b3   RPM 5.0 beta 3                 [DONE]
     2007-12-30  RPM 5.0b4   RPM 5.0 beta 4                 [TODO]
   
  3. release in January 2008:
     - APIs:     fully fixed, guaranteed to be kept stable
     - code:     stable, no more bugs known bugs left 
     - audience: RPM community as a whole
     - purpose:  provide RPM 5.0

     ...

  KNOWN PENDING ISSUES
  --------------------

  This is the list of known pending issues which still *HAVE* to be
  resolved during release engineering. Please do not just list any
  *CANDO* items.

  o to be resolved before RPM 5.0b4 (i.e. *BEFORE* 2007-12-30 20:00 UTC+0100):
    - jbj: fix openssl RSA signature verification.
    - jbj: finish Requires: sanitycheck(N) = E:V-R runtime probe.
    - jbj: finish BuildRequires: vcheck(N) = E:V-R runtime probe.
    - jbj: write up added featlets/bugtures in %docdir notes.
    - jbj: handle SourceN: foo-V-R.src.rpm unpacking.
    - jbj: fix (or at least document) the /sbin/ldconfig optimization flaw.
    - jbj: finish --trust with --import (or punt to 5.1).
    - jbj: add build script templates for install scriptlets (or punt to 5.1).
    - jbj: change RPM_I18NSTRING_TYPE wiring to use arbitrary tag.
    - jbj: markReplacedFiles() subtly rewrites header back into rpmdb
	with altered RPMTAG_FILESTATES data. get/del/add sequence
	is needed instead.
    - jbj: VSFlags (and --nodigest/--nosignature) is now global rather than
	persistently per-transaction. That means its no longer possible to
	have two transactions, one which verifies signatures while the other
	does not. Per-transaction VSFlags never made much sense imho, but
	some may care. Establishing a end-user, not a per-application or
	per-transaction, package integrity/security policy is the only
	rational end-point.
    - jbj: there's a buildroot compatibility issue that needs to be addressed
	in (at least) doco. The problem is common to rpm-4_5 and HEAD.
	Issue at
		http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=34705
    - jbj: make a complete pass through rpm.org check-ins and make sure they
	have exactly zero "features" that are not already in rpm-5.0. With
	full attribution of course ...

  o to be resolved before RPM 5.0.0:
    - rse: NEWS polishing
    - afb: clean up build macros for the %macosx platforms (incl. fat/*64)

  RPM 5.1 ROADMAP ISSUES
  ----------------------
    - jbj: Heh, --import has *always* used the wrong data type for
	Summary/Description/Group. The header that carries the pubkey
	lacks RPMTAG_ARCH/RPMTAG_OS as well. Re-importing all pubkeys is
	one solution, but perhaps a "just works" slam-dunk hack is needed
	during --rebuildb, or with header extensions. When this issue is
	resolved, then rpm can/should use implicit, rather than explicit, data
	types for tag data.
    - jbj: add libTomCrypt signature verification.
    - jbj: add per-implementation crypto hashes.
    - jbj: add per-implementation symmetric ciphers.
    - jbj: permit per-file encryption with password caching through keyutils.
    - jbj: generalize the Leopard XAR format to ar (as in *.deb), tar, and cpio.
    - jbj: eliminate the oddball *.src.rpm paths, nuke rpmInstallSourcePackage.
    - jbj: VPATH-like generalization to fold-in splitted-source-directory patch.
    - jbj: add per file RPMTAG_ENTROPY a la Shannon to start making the choice
	of compression scheme computible.
    - jbj: explicitly compute sums of header and package sizes to help
	distro maintainers understand their cdrom/dvd and memory footprint
	needs.
    - jbj: split rpmtsRun() into 2 pieces, moving the file resolution
	computation into its own method.
    - jbj: redesign the bleeping callback, which is good for nothing but pushing
	script kiddie progress bars across the screen.
    - jbj: arbitrary "%foo -p /bar" scriptlets as pair'ed RPMTAG_{FOO,FOOPROG}.
    - jbj: arbitrary triggers, like scriptlets, but with a condition check too.
    - jbj: the hash *ahem* algorithm at rpmdb/fprint.c:186 fpHashFunction() is
	pathetic. FYI, the fingerprint hash is in the top 10 pigs when
	profiling rpm installs, so better has immediate performance benefits.
	rpmio/lookup3.c is possibly better. The other important usage case
	is restructuring the multi-level add package "provides" lookup in
	lib/rpmal.c (but that likely needs to be thrown into a Berkeley DB
	table to minimize memory footprint).
    - jbj: using qsort to insure that nearly sorted lists of join keys in
	an rpmdb remain sorted is stoopid: quicksort on nearly sorted lists
	is slower than alternative implementations like mergesort.
    - jbj: eliminate internal --initdb (useless) and --verifydb (peculier
	to Berkeley DB and adequately/equivalently achievable with db_verify).
    - jbj: NSS has many memory leaks that are not free'd by NSS_Shutdown().
    - jbj: this leak needs fixing somewhen:
==3436== 12 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 3 of 9
==3436==    at 0x4805525: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:149)
==3436==    by 0x4934365: argvSplit (argv.c:207)
==3436==    by 0x48F89F9: tagLoadATags (tagname.c:31)
==3436==    by 0x48F969E: _tagValue (tagname.c:361)
==3436==    by 0x48F9805: tagValue (tagname.c:403)
==3436==    by 0x48878F9: rpmdsSysinfo (rpmds.c:1600)
==3436==    by 0x48A5BDE: rpmtsCreate (rpmts.c:1302)
==3436==    by 0x3EFA: main (rpmqv.c:540)
    - jbj: eliminate %patch-as-macro-in-C implementation.
    - jbj: convert unused syntax (like Disttag:/Repotag:/Cvsid:) to arbitrary tags
    - jbj: convert %prep/%build/%install/%check/%clean to arbitrary srpm tags.
    - jbj: use devtool.sh as a model for an arbitrary state machine that
	runs arbitrary scripts in deterministic order, checking error codes.
	Rewrite rpmbuild.c accordingly.
    - jbj: hmmm, arbitrary Foo: (except for Class:) ends up in binary *.rpm's,
	while %foo (like %track) ends up in *.src.rpm's. I'll pretend that's
	a feature until a means to more precisely specify arbitrary tag
	copying into binary/source rpm's is devised.
    - jbj: rpm --help using popt-1.13 with non-utf8 needs some work.
	POPT_fprintf using iconv(3) is the common element so far.
    - jbj: MacPorts is going to universal binaries (the Mac OS X equivalent
	of multilib) with a "fat" arch in *.rpm packages. Better can be done,
	including insturmenting running lipo(1) automagically during install.
    - jbj: build/build.c doScript() was a crack-soaked proof-of-concept build
	system script invoker with macro templates that I threw together on
	a Saturday afternoon in November, 1999. Noone has ever bothered to
	rewrite the goop sadly, far better could and should be done.
    - jbj: users continually expect the ability to create "noarch" subpkgs even
	though rpm has only a single build (and arch is a constant for that build).
	Permitting noarch subpkgs is no more complicated than applying an
	explict sanity check that, indeed, the subpkg contents are "noarch".
    - jbj: both --yaml and --xml are in need of QA regression tests.
	2 of 1300 packages fail to YAML load correctly. One of the
	failure cases was irregular white space in %description,
	the other case involved RPM_I18NSTRING_TYPE.
    - jbj: XOR operator needed, such that Requires: LSB ^ !LSB has valid 
        truth table
    - jbj: RFE: capture arbitrary 'defines' from the ENV, and the invocation 
	command line, each to end up in binary *.rpm's to show more of build 
	time options
    - jbj: rewrite pgpReadPkts to return array of clearsign'd segments instead.
    - jbj: teach argvSplit about escaped seperator characters.
