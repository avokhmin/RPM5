.SH NAME
rpmcache \- Cache RPM Package Headers for Solving Dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP


\fBrpmcache\fR \fB\fIPACKAGE_NAME\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrpmcache\fR walks a file tree, possibly remotely using
\fBFTP\fR, filtering paths using
\fBglob\fR(7) expressions, reading
package headers. The \fIPACKAGE_NAME\fR
arguments are used to construct a \fBglob\fR(7)
expression that will match any of specific package names within
the Red Hat build system, and are almost certainly not of use to
anyone outside of Red Hat.
.PP
There are no \fBrpmcache\fR specific options, only common \fBrpm\fR options.
See the \fBrpmcache\fR usage message for what is currently implemented.
