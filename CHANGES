2.1.2 -> 2.1.3:
	- don't fail, and do report, if -K can't find a PGP key

2.1.1 -> 2.1.2:
	- fixed error message for unrelocateable packages
        - automatic shared lib provides now work with buildprefix
	- fixed dependency checking during upgrades to work if the
	  package wasn't previously installed
	- clean up temp file after signature check
	- dependencies weren't looking through packages that were
	  being installed at the same time quite right

2.1 -> 2.1.1:
	- fixed -qi query format 

2.0.11 -> 2.1:
        - added --requires, --whatrequires, --provides and 
	  --whatprovides queries
	- using a string array tag in a queryformat results in every
	  item in the string being printed out with spaces in between
	  (though this behaviour will probably go away shortly)
	- all packages are ftp'd before any are installed (required to
	  do proper dependency checking)
	- if only source packages are being installed, the database is
	  never opened
	- automatic shared library require/provides tags generated
	- added --nodeps flag for install and uninstall
	- added dependency checking for installs and uninstalls
	- misc fixes to compile with glibc
	- use PGPPATH if set (and no pgp_path: in rpmrc)
	- remove pgp_pubring, pgp_secring stuff
	- new extensible signature
	- signature section supports multiple signatures
	- --addsign to add a signature to a package
	- PGP key no longer limited to 1024 bits
	- always do at least an MD5 "signature"
	  as a result, -K will always tell you something
	- signatures now include a simple "header+archive size" check
          just calling readSignature() checks this
	- --nopgp (with -K) to skip PGP check, just do MD5
	- allow '#' comments in preamble and %files section
	- fixed -qsv to print both the states and the file information	
	- added --dump option to query to print all file attributes
	- installs with --root use the /etc/passwd and /etc/group from
	  the target directory
	- added --initdb to aid in database initialization
	- --queryformat can print items of type INT8
	- "sourceless" packages with nosource: and nopatch:
	- [] now allows interation through query formats
	- '-' flag for query tags removed
	- :date and :perms supported as query format specifiers
	- new rpmrc entries "arch" and "os" to override
	- --arch and --os on the command line to override
	- arch and os are now strings in the package header
	- added arch_compat handling in /etc/rpmrc
	- added build_arch to /etc/rpmrc
	- support arch as string
	- added --ignorearch option
	- Prefix: in spec file to specify default installation prefix
	- rpmrc and command line may be used to override the path
	  used for the rpm database
	- relocatable packages get installed properly
	- added support for --prefix and RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX environemtn
	  variable
	- added dependency checking for version numbers
	- added correct dependency checking for upgrades
	- added :depflags query format flag
	- changes --provides, --requires, and --scripts queries to use
	  queryFormats

2.0.10 -> 2.0.11:
        - fixed chmod(symlink) bug (since 2.0.9)

2.0.9 -> 2.0.10:
	- fixed the fix to rpm -q <num> bug
	  to query by number you now need --querybynumber
	- made arch_sensitive on by default
	- handle # comments in preamble
	- don't barf if we can't canonicalize the hostname during builds
	- fixed --verify with --root

2.0.8 -> 2.0.9:
	- %files -f <file>
	- prelim Require/Provide handling
	- prelim strict checking of spec file
	- removed some bash-isms
	- fixed globbing/root bug
	- fixed rpm -q <num> bug
	- fixed ftw() related bug where symlinks were being
	  followed in %files rather than just being noted!!
	- pass "upgrade" arg to pre/post scripts when upgrading
	- use PATH to find cpio when installing
	- fixed rpm.magic, added sun4, mips, 68k, sgi, sunos, solaris
	- added %attr(mode owner group) feature to file list
	- fixed dumb %verify() parse bug

2.0.7 -> 2.0.8:
	- explicitly turn off ASCII armor when running PGP
	- fixed --noscripts logic, which was on by default and 
	  off if you specified it!
	- uses a temp file to pass filenames to cpio in case when 
	  their are more then 500 filenames in a package
	- added --rcfile
	- fixed problem with $HOME/.rcfile not being read
	- undocumented --search, --where, --keep-temps which
	  will probably won't be implemented in RPM 2.x anyway

2.0.6 -> 2.0.7:
        - builds now set umask 022 for all scripts
	- queries relative paths correctly (thanks to Johnie Stafford)
	- fixed error codes for failed installs
	- don't add NULL entry to group index for packages that don't
	  have group information, add it to the "Unknown" group instead
	- added --scripts query option
	- added --noscripts for installing and uninstall without using 
	  the pre/post scripts
	- "rpm -qd" and "rpm -qc" work properly now (they didn't imply
	   -l before)

2.0.5 -> 2.0.6:
	- internal changes to error messages

2.0.4 -> 2.0.5:
	- added support for generic querying
	- added --querytags option
	- updated man page for above two
	- short-circuit got added before 2.0.5, but I don't know when
	- query and installs should now return 0 on success and nonzero
	  otherwise (rpm -i should return the number of packages that
	  failed actually)
	- made rpm -qa fail if extra arguments are passed to it

2.0.3 -> 2.0.4:
	- added support for PowerPC, and OSF mklinux ports
	- added --resign
	- added --recompile
	- added verbose error messages from Tyson Sawyer
	- rpmconvert won't overwrite an existing database
	- won't core dump querying old format source packages
	- freed minor memory leak
	- more descriptive error messages during build
	- added support for not installing documentation

2.0.2 -> 2.0.3:
	- added support for 686, 786, 886, 986

2.0.1 -> 2.0.2:

	- uses /var/tmp rather then /usr/tmp during for ftp space
	- added debugging messages to ftp.c
	- fixed some mistakes in the PGP section of the man page
	- added mdfile prototype to rpmlib.h - the Python module wants this
	- fixed struct oldrpmlead to align properly on the alpha

2.0	- everything done :-)

2.0b -> 2.0c:
	- an incredible number of changes - I won't bother trying to 
	  list them

2.0a -> 2.0b:
	- moved build stuff to main rpm command, though --rebuild is still
	  not supported
	- install should work, although replaced files are not marked as
	  replaced
	- %doc macro fixed
	- --percent, --hash work for installs
	- converted databases and packages get the file list in the correct
	  order now
	- none of this is well tested
	- rpms are output to proper dirs (which are always arch sensitive)
	- basic rpmrc functions are implemented, full parsing is present
	- changed error messages for missing files to include full path
	- fixed detection of Alpha's

1.4.6 -> 2.0a:

	  (this will be corrected)
	- an awful lot is still missing - this is an ALPHA release

1.4.5 -> 1.4.6:

	- added --root to man page, usage, and help messages
	- added a " " to the "Creating directory" debug message in install.pl
