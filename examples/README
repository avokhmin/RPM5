These are the example programs from MaximumRPM, updated to today's rpmlib.
You can find MaximumRPM on the http://www.rpm.org/ site.

To build these, edit the makefile as appropriate (if you're using gcc,
you should not have to change anything), then "make all".  3 utilities
will be built:


dumprpm:    % dumprpm filename

   Dumps a textual description of the the contents of the named RPM
   file on disk.


showdb:     % showdb rpmname

   Dumps a textual description of the named RPM.  The RPM must be
   currently installed in the database.


showdb2:    % showdb2 rpmname

   Dumps a textual description of the named RPM, like showdb.  However,
   uses a database query rather than a brute-force scan to locate the
   rpm (should be much more efficient).



You will also find the string.txt file.  This documents the only
difficulty I had updating these programs.
