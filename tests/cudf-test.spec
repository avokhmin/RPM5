%description
Some remarks about the example follow.

* The example does not rely on any extended properties.
* Intuitively, the example comes from a packaging world where different
  versions of the same package are implicitly conflicting with each other.
  To grasp this, all packages for which multiple versions are available
  declare a non-versioned conflicts with themselves. 
* The engine feature is mutually exclusive, only one (installed) package
  can provide it. This is encoded using conï¬‚icts with the feature from
  each package providing it.
